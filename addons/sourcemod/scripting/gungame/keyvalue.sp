/**
 * Ranking and Player Data.
 */

/**
 * How to store other player data rank/wins like this. How to do this so it fast?
 * Lookup fast so we can change the keyvalue wins. Have to search for any matching steamid.
 * If not then create a new entry.
 *
 * Pruning old data out? Config file with option NumberOfDays to prune or something like that.
 * By default 30 days since the player has enter the server. 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 2592000
 * new TimeStamp[2] GetTime(TimeStamp); I believe [0] is the 32 bit timestamp. (Need to check)
 *
 * new NumberOfDaysInSeconds = 86400 * DaysVariableFromConfig;
 * if(Player_TimeStamp <= (TimeStamp[0] - NumberOfDaysInSeconds)) { // Delete player from player data ranking }
 * They been away from the server for 30 days already. Clear out old information.
 *
 * To update the player TimeStamp? on PutInServer or join of team/class? Probably best on join after class.
 * Will this have alot of impact on the server? ie long list? will it cause lag?
 *
 * Player has to have aleast one win to be in the list.

 /* keyvalues?. It would be faster if the news header was the rank so faster replace
 * or news header would be Authid for faster lookup instead of going rank->Authid? Which one would be better?
 *
 * We always read top10 into memory and read in OnPluginStart. No need to reload it every single map unless it changed.
 * Add a command in the top10/rank plugin to allow reloading of the top10 (ie admin need editing the top10 list).
 *
 * When a change has occur have a bool:var change to true. When OnMapEnd() is call write clear and write out the new top10
 * list otherwise don't do anything. I believe this is the best way so it doesn't have to reload every map change.
